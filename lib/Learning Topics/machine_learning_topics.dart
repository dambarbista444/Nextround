    The Curse of Dimensionality refers to the various issues that arise when working with high-dimensional data. As the number of features increases, the volume of the feature space grows exponentially, making the data sparse. This sparsity leads to difficulties in learning models, as there are not enough samples to cover the feature space.

    Techniques to address the curse of dimensionality include:
    - Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or autoencoders.
    - Feature selection methods to retain only the most relevant features.
    - Regularization methods like L1 (Lasso) to avoid overfitting.

    Attention-based models, such as the Transformer architecture, eliminate the need for sequential data processing found in RNNs and LSTMs by using self-attention mechanisms. These mechanisms allow models to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, making attention-based models more efficient for long sequences.
